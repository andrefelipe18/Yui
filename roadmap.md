# Roadmap for future

Yui was born as a way to keep motivated to study PHP outside of laravel, since 2022 I've been using laravel on a daily basis and I felt stuck with it (not that it's a bad thing).

This mini framework made from the heart has helped me understand how Laravel processes work behind the scenes.
